## Frontend Selection
In two to three sentences, give a description on the frontend you are to build. Is it going to be a Web frontend? A Discord bot? What external packages, libraries, or frameworks would you need?

Do this **before** you go on to writing your user stores!


## User Stories + DoDs  
Make sure to follow the *Role, Goal, Benefit* framework for the user stories and the *Given/When/Then* framework for the Definitions of Done! For the DoDs, think about both success and failure scenarios. You can also refer to the examples DoDs in [C3 spec](https://sites.google.com/view/ubc-cpsc310-22w2/project/checkpoint-3).

### User Story 1

As a \<role\>, I want to \<goal\>, so that \<benefit\>.

#### Definitions of Done(s)

Scenario 1: \<The  name  for  the  behaviour  that  will  be  described\> \
Given: \<Some  initial  application  state  (precondition)\> \
When: \<The  user  do  some  series  of  action\> \
Then: \<Some  outcome  state  is  expected  (post-condition)\>

Scenario 2: \<The  name  for  the  behaviour  that  will  be  described\> \
Given: \<Some  initial  application  state  (precondition)\> \
When: \<The  user  do  some  series  of  action\> \
Then: \<Some  outcome  state  is  expected  (post-condition)\>

### Others

You may provide any additional user stories + DoDs in this section for general TA feedback.

But these will not be graded.
